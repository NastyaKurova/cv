I am interested in\nnew technologies and how to use them. I worked on an AngularJs\nproject with Node.js backend, then I refactored it to a React\napplication with stack TypeScript, React, Redux toolkit, Jest, React\nTesting Library. I developed projects from start and wrote libs for\nthem. Worked with IndexedDB and WebSocket. Wrote unit and\ncomponent tests. Also, marked up websites and landings.
