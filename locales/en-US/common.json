  "about": "I am a Frontend-developer with more than 4 years of experience, live in Tbilisi now. I enjoy developing beautiful and convenient web interfaces, be a part of the developing process and see results of my work. I am interested in new technologies and how to use them. I worked on an AngularJs project with Node.js backend, then I refactored it to a React application. I developed projects from start and wrote libs for them. Worked with IndexedDB. Wrote unit and component tests. I think it is important to write understandable and simple code. Also, marked up websites and landings.\nMy main stack: React, TypeScript, Redux, CSS, HTML, Node.js\nI am searching for a remote work with possibility of relocation to other countries.",
